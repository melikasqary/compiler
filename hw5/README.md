## Description

This project aims to calculate the number of classes in a codebase using Understand. It utilizes the Understand Python module to analyze the code and retrieve the required information.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following packages installed:

-   `os`
-   `sys`
-   `understand`

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    Plain TextCopy code
    
    ```Plain
    git clone https://github.com/melikasqary/compiler.git
    
    ```
    
2.  Add the `understand` Python module directory to your system's PATH. You can do this by following these steps:
    
    -   Download and install Understand from  [SciTools](https://scitools.com/).
    -   Add the  `understand`  module directory (e.g., "C:\Program Files\SciTools\bin\pc-win64\Python") to your system's PATH.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
    
4.  Run the Python script:
    
    Plain TextCopy code
    
    ```Plain
    python hw5.py
    
    ```
    

## Usage

1.  Open the Python script in a text editor.
    
2.  Modify the `db.open()` function with the path to your specific codebase in the `C:\Users\melika\OpenUnderstand\benchmark\JSON\src\src.udb` format.
    
3.  Save the changes.
    
4.  Run the Python script.
    
5.  The total number of classes will be displayed in the console.
